# Suskind Knowledge Graph

This project introduces a graph-based framework designed to complement traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Central to this approach is a dynamic graph where nodes are featured entities, interconnected with contextual relevance. This structure allows for a nuanced understanding of relationships and context, offering precision beyond linear text analysis. The database is the culmination of three years of  data collection, manually undertaken to ensure quality. To facilitate user interaction, multiple Command Line Interfaces (CLI) makes database management intuitive. It also incorporates algorithms of graph search that can be configured on the fly, further enhancing its adaptability and utility for diverse data interaction needs.

## Documentation
The following [documentation](https://yago-mendoza.gitbook.io/suskind_knowledge_graph/) provides an exhaustive study of all components of the system, especially those related with the CLIs interaction.

  - Create a test corpus aligned with the principles of "atomicity" and "proximity".
    
  - **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**
    - Research and select an appropriate LLM for the task.
    - Dessign the display to rate the success (granularity + contextual placement).
    - **Testing and Validation**
      - Implement the heuristic model on a subset of data.
      - Monitor performance and adjust prompting to maximize success rate.
        
- **CLI Integration**
  - Dessign a pipeline that connects AI generative capabilities with a gateway on CLI.
  - Test success rate with updated tooling.
