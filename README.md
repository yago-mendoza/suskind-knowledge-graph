# Suskind Knowledge Graph

This documentation presents the Graph-based Framework for NLP, a system enhancing NLP through graph techniques, inspired by GNNs and graph transformer models. It features a dynamic graph where entities as nodes are linked by contextual relevance, offering improved relationship and context understanding beyond linear text analysis. The database, built from three years of detailed data collection, ensures quality. The framework includes Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for straightforward database management and supports customizable graph search algorithms for flexible data exploration. This integration provides a powerful tool for NLP, combining graph-based analysis with dynamic algorithm customization for diverse analytical needs.

## Documentation
The following [documentation](https://yago-mendoza.gitbook.io/suskind_knowledge_graph/) provides an exhaustive study of all components of the system, especially those related with the CLIs interaction.

    - Research and select an appropriate LLM for the task.
    - Dessign the display to rate the success (granularity + contextual placement).
    - **Testing and Validation**
      - Implement the heuristic model on a subset of data.
      - Monitor performance and adjust prompting to maximize success rate.
        
- **CLI Integration**
  - Dessign a pipeline that connects AI generative capabilities with a gateway on CLI.
  - Test success rate with updated tooling.
