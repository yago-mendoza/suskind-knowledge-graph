Since my last report, this employee has reached rock-bottom and shows signs of starting to dig.
His men would follow him anywhere, but only out of morbid curiosity.
I would not allow this employee to breed.
This associate is really not so much of a has-been but more of a definitely won't be.
He would be out of his depth in a parking lot puddle.
This young lady has delusions of adequacy.
This employee should go far. And the sooner the better.
This employee is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.
He sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve them.
