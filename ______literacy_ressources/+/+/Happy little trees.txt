Yeah so Bob, what will make us happy?
Well, if you ask me. I'd say it's accidents.
Accidents, acidents will make us happy?
They sure will.
That doesn't make any sense Bob. Why will accidents make us happy?
Well, accidents make you real sad. And once your're sad, there's no place to go but back to being happy.
So you want to be sad?
Yeah, sure I don't mind it.
Why?
Because that means that, eventually, I'll be happy.
Oh, so you want to be happy.
Yes and no.
Why not just yes?
Cause once I'm happy there's no place to go but back down to being sad.
Yes but you don't want to be sad do you?
Well, sure I want to be sad.
Why?
Cause it means I have nowhere else to go but back to being happy.
So the goal is to be happy, even if you go through misery to get there.
Be happy? No. The attempt to be, well, sure, why not?
But there's no point in attempting to be happy if you don't eventually get there, Bob.
Well sure there is. The goal is to never quite get there.
That's the whole point: to not have a point.
So you always want to be painting, but never actually paint anything.
That's the idea. Tell the story without ending it.
If it never ends, it never begins, it just is.
But we'll just keep going around in meaningless circles.
Well isn't that what we are doing anyway? The least you can do, is have fun on your trip to nowhere.
But I want to be happy.
Yes, so do I. I want to be happy like these happy little trees here.
